1. I feel very confident in my understanding of Arrays so far. 
2. I'm really looking foward to learning more methods as well as tying this together with other code I've learned so far. I feel good about what I've learned, but I'd like to do some more examples to really get it down.
3. I'm wondering what the most used methods are.
